## Problem Statement
The problem is the challenge of tracking and understanding significant events amidst information overload. The solution involves creating a system that continuously extracts real-time news data from public sources and Airrchip APIs. This system employs NLP techniques, large language models, and network analysis to categorize events, construct an interactive network graph, and evaluate connections. The goal is to design a user-friendly interface allowing exploration and interaction with the graph while ensuring scalability and performance with large volumes of dynamic data.
